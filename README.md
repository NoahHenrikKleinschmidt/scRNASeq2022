# scRNA-Seq Data Analysis Project by <font style="color:DodgerBlue;">EcoTyper</font>


This project analyses scRNA-Seq data from hepatocellular carcinoma using the EcoTyper software by [Steen/Luca et al. (2021)](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(21)00451-7). This repository contains scripts used for data analysis and environment setup. 

# Outline

This project aims to assess the uses of EcoTyper for scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data in context of Hepatcarcinoma. We are going to analyse scRNA-seq (15 cancer, 2 normal) and bulk RNA-seq (~120 cancer) samples to identify the different ecotypes in there. 

1. Assess EcoType Discovery 
   1. [ ] from scRNA-seq
   2. [ ] from bulk RNA-seq
   3. [ ] from spacial transcriptomics data
2. Assess EcoType Recovery 
   1. From scRNA-seq
      1. [ ] using default "Carcinoma"
      2. [ ] using our own discovered state
   2. From bulk RNA-seq
      1. [ ] using default "Carcinoma"
      2. [ ] using our own discovered state
   3. From spacial transcriptomics data
      1. [ ] using default "Carcinoma"
      2. [ ] using our own discovered state
