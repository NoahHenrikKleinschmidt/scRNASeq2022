# This is the config file for Experiment 01: discovery of cell states in scRNA-seq data
#
# Alrighty, currently this stuff is not yet working because the wilcoxon rank stuff just returns all NaN whatever...
# why is another matter so let't test if we can use the default Carcinoma state to recover ecotypes in our 
# data to check if the problem is already in the datafiles...
