# This is the config file for Experiment 01: discovery of cell states in scRNA-seq data
#
# Alrighty, currently this stuff is not yet working because the wilcoxon rank stuff just returns all NaN whatever...
# why is another matter so let't test if we can use the default Carcinoma state to recover ecotypes in our 
# data to check if the problem is already in the datafiles...

default :
    Input :    
        Discovery dataset name : "mylivercells"

        # we will use the ENSG-id version of the data because the gene names must be unique for this step to work...
        # and for some reason it appears as though we have repeated gene symbols (whyever?, maybe isoforms that just got the same name anyway...)
