In here we try out what Kassandra can do in terms of cell-type deconvolution...
Regrettably, their resources are pretty sparce and are pretty much limited to one tiny jupyter notebook and their paper of course. So we will try to feed our bulk data to them and check what we get out. Their paper primises a gold out of mud essentially but they did not even manage to package their shitty code (which is not shitty actually but looks kinda nice...). We'll see what they can deliver...

Note

The Kassandra part has been postponed until further notice...
